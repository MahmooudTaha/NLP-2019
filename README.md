Project Defenition:

Named-entity recognition (NER) (also known as entity identification, entity chunking and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entity mentions in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as the person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

# Dataset: GMB(Groningen Meaning Bank)

## Context
Annotated Corpus for Named Entity Recognition using GMB(Groningen Meaning Bank) corpus for entity classification with enhanced and popular features by Natural Language Processing applied to the data set.

## Content
This is the extract from GMB corpus which is tagged, annotated and built specifically to train the classifier to predict named entities such as name, location, etc.

## Number of tagged entities
`'O': 1146068', geo-nam': 58388, 'org-nam': 48034, 'per-nam': 23790, 'gpe-nam': 20680, 'tim-dat': 12786, 'tim-dow': 11404, 'per-tit': 9800, 'per-fam': 8152 'tim-yoc': 5290, 'tim-moy': 4262, 'per-giv': 2413, 'tim-clo': 891, 'art-nam': 866, 'eve-nam': 602, 'nat-nam': 300, 'tim-nam': 146, 'eve-ord': 107, 'per-ini': 60 'org-leg': 60, 'per-ord': 38, 'tim-dom': 10, 'per-mid': 1, 'art-add': 1`

## Essential info about entities

 - geo = Geographical Entity
 - org = Organization
 - per = Person
 - gpe = Geopolitical Entity
 - tim = Time indicator
 - art = Artifact
 - eve = Event
 - nat = Natural Phenomenon
 - Total Words Count = 1354149 Target Data Column: "tag"

## Inspiration
This dataset is getting more interested because of more features added to the recent version of this dataset. Also, it helps to create a broad view of Feature Engineering with respect to this dataset.

Why this dataset is helpful or playful?

It might not sound so interested for earlier versions, but when you are able to pick intent and custom named entities from your own sentence with more features then, it is getting interested and helps you solve real business problems(like picking entities from Electronic Medical Records, etc)
